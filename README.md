# AG_Vector
Calculator of Vector

🛠️ **Work in progress** 🛠️

# History 📜

This program allow the user to simply calculate every operation you can do with **vectors** in <mark>R<sup>n</sup></mark>. </br>

You can calculate: </br>

- <mark>norma</mark>
- <mark>scalar product</mark>
- <mark>vectorial product</mark>
- <mark>algorithm of Gauss</mark> (for matrix)
- <mark>adding/moltiplying/dividing/subtracting two vectors</mark>
- <mark>the distance between two vectors</mark>
- and other functions ...

# New features 🆕
I'm implementing the <mark>single-command-function</mark>, what does it mean ? </br>
This means that the user can write the equation into a single command (according to the rule of the program).</br>
Here an example:
>``$ ||(2, 6, 7)||`` </br>
>Or </br>
>``$ ||(2, 6, 7) + (-4, 5, 2)||`` </br>
>Or </br>
>``$ pr[(1, 2, 3)]((4, 6, 8))``
</br>

You can also add into an array the vectors you want to use later (adding also an identifier character): </br>
>``$ Array [ ``</br>
>``    v => (1, 2, 3),`` </br>
>``     w => (3, 4, 5) ``</br>
>``]`` </br>
>``$ prv(w)``
</br>
